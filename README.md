# FragmentStateSaver

An Android library that holds fragment states. The fragment will be created only for first time after that the state will be save in the transaction. It is best for bottom navigation view where user navigate the pages multiple times with bottom navigation view. So that the fragment will not create again and again it will be visible from the back stack.
